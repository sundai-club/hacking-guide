# hacking-guide
This repo is a How To Guide with Sundai's practices, tips and most often used ways of working. All these practises are descriptive--helpful and guiding--instead of prescriptive. These pratises are in flux as new tools and ways of coding quickly evolve. 

The goal is to bring new hackers quickly up to speed as well as give experienced hackers the overview of the club's usual way of working. 

Happy coding!
